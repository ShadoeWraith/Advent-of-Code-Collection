# Advent of Code Collection

Learning Go and thought this would be a fun way to play around with the language.

These are my solutions to the challenges presented on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). If I skip any challenges I will mention I skipped it in the main.go file of the corresponding day, but will still find a solution and put it here so I can easily view it and learn from it.

### What is Advent of Code?

_"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."_
